🚧 Work in Progress

**MoviesTracker** is a personal portfolio project for tracking movies and TV shows across different watch states such as watched, want to watch, or stopped. Titles can be rated using a 5-star rating system.

The application is built with [**NestJS**](https://nestjs.com/), following a modular architecture that promotes scalability, testability, and clear separation of concerns. It is designed to support the [**MoviesTracker frontend**](https://github.com/NLav/MoviesTracker).

The codebase follows clean code principles and emphasizes maintainability and consistency, supported by [**ESLint**](https://eslint.org/) and [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io/) to enforce code quality and formatting standards.
